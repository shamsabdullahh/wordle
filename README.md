# Wordle in Arabic

## Brief Description 
Winter 2025 - Second Semester

In this project, we created a mobile application for the famous game 'Wordle' but in the arabic language. The goal of this game is that the user will have a N length of cells that will hold each letter in an anonymous word. The user has 6 tries to try and guess the word with hints provided by the color-changing cells.
This game is considered as an intermiediate puzzle, for all ages!
