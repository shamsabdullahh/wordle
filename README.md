# Wordle in Arabic

## Brief Description 
Winter 2025 - Second Semester

In this project, we created a mobile application for the famous game 'Wordle' but in the arabic language. The goal of this game is that the user will have a N length of cells that will hold each letter in an anonymous word. The user has 6 tries to try and guess the word with hints provided by the color-changing cells.
This game is considered as an intermiediate puzzle, for all ages!


## Setup of The Project
This project was made possible using the programming language React Native for mobile developement and Andriod Studio for the virtual iOS and Andriod emmulator devices.

## Screen Structure

### About The Structure
The application has two main portols that contribute to the project. The first portol is a general platform that allows users to access the Game Screen easily without needing to login. The general platform has limitations for users such as the following:

* Limited Words in local database that are considered "easy to guess".
* No game points collection; no ranks to accomplish.
* Points are not saved.

  On the other hand, there is a second platform that requires user authentication to be able to access. This has the advantages of what was limited before with the addition of:

  * Tab navigation that leads to two screens:
      * Leaderboard: which shows the highest point of all players 'globally'.
      * Account: the user's account, which shows the accomplished Rank Badges that he won from the points he gained while playing.
